When providing feedback be very clear what your comments apply to,

### 4 - Sketch Intro 

Sketch is a vector drawing tool. Vectors describe shapes as points in space
connected by straight or curved lines. Lines can be have a stroke, and closed 
shapes can have a fill. 

!important: Vector drawings can be scaled to any size without loss of resolution. 

This is in constrast to bit map images which are a collection of pixels. 
For computers pixel data is easy to draw less processor intensive. 
Vector drawings on the other hand are more processor intensive. 
Pixels data take up more memory and storage. While vectors are usually 
much smaller.
